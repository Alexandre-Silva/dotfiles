    Font rasterization converts vector font data to bitmap data so that it can be displayed. The result can appear jagged due to aliasing. anti-aliasing is enabled by default and increases the apparent resolution of font edges.

    <!--
    Font hinting (also known as instructing) is the use of mathematical instructions to adjust the display of an outline font so that it lines up with a rasterized grid, (i.e. the pixel grid of the display). Its intended effect is to make fonts appear more crisp so that they are more readable. Fonts will line up correctly without hinting when displays have around 300 DPI. Two types of hinting are available.

    <!--
    Hintstyle is the amount of font reshaping done to line up to the grid. Hinting values are: hintnone, hintslight, hintmedium, and hintfull. hintslight will make the font more fuzzy to line up to the grid but will be better in retaining font shape, while hintfull will be a crisp font that aligns well to the pixel grid but will lose a greater amount of font shape. Preferences vary.

Subpixel rendering
Most monitors manufactured today use the Red, Green, Blue (RGB) specification. Fontconfig will need to know your monitor type to be able to display your fonts correctly. Monitors are either: RGB (most common), BGR, V-RGB (vertical), or V-BGR.

LCD filter
When using subpixel rendering, you should enable the LCD filter, which is designed to reduce colour fringing. This is described under LCD filtering in the FreeType 2 API reference. Different options are described under FT_LcdFilter, and are illustrated by this LCD filter test page.

The lcddefault filter will work for most users. Other filters are available that can be used in special situations: lcdlight; a lighter filter ideal for fonts that look too bold or fuzzy, lcdlegacy, the original Cairo filter; and lcdnone to disable it entirely.
